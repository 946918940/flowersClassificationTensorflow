# Tensorflow Flowers Classifier

For all those flower lovers out there, here is a Tensorflow image classifier that can predict the species of a flower from its photo. This model is trained to detect 5 different species of flowers.

1. daisy
2. dandelion
3. roses
4. sunflowers
5. tulips

Feel free to fork and play around with the classifier.

## How to run the basic model

For an image located at \<path-to-image-file\>, run :

```sh
python classifier.py --image_path <path-to-image-file>
```
